I utilized the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/) API to create a quiz app. One of the specific requirements was to incorporate questions with images. However, the API itself does not provide questions with images. To fulfill this requirement, I manually generated questions with images and integrated them with the API's questions.
